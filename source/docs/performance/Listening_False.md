title: Disable Listening Shapes Tip
---

You can set `listening(false)` to shape to remove it from hit graph. It will increase performance.
In some cases it may be very useful and will not touch whole logic of your application.

For example we have a button (group) with rectangle and text. We need to listen click on button.
It this case we can remove text from hit graph and listen click only from rectangle.
