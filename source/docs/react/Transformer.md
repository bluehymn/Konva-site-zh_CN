title: How to resize and rotate canvas shapes with react and konva?
layout: react_page
---

Currently there is no good pure declarative "react-way" to use Transformer tool.
But you still can use it with some small manual requests to the Konva nodes.
And it will work just fine.

Idea: you need to create `Konva.Transformer` node, and attach it into required node manually.

Instructions: click on shape to select it.
