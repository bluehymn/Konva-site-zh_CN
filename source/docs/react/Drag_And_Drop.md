title: Drag and drop canvas shapes
layout: react_page
---

To enable drag&drop for any node on canvas you just need to pass `draggable` property into the component.

When you drag&drop shape it is recommended to save its position into you app store. You can use `onDragMove` and `onDragEnd` events for that purpose.
