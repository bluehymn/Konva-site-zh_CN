title: HTML5 Canvas Simple Easings Tutorial
---

To create a non linear easing tween with Konva, we can set the `easing`
property to an easing function.  Other than `Konva.Easings.Linear`,
the other most common easings are `Konva.Easings.EaseIn`,
`Konva.Easings.EaseInOut`, and `Konva.Easings.EaseOut`.

For all available easings go to [Easings Documentation](/cn.konvajs/api/Konva.Easing.html).

Instructions: Mouseover or touchstart the boxes to tween them with different easing functions
