title: HTML5 Canvas Move Shape to Another Container Tutorial
---

To move a shape from one container into another with Konva, we can use the
`moveTo()` method which requires a container as a parameter.
A container can be another stage, a layer, or a group.  You can also move groups
into other groups and layers, or shapes from groups directly into other layers.

Instructions: Drag and drop the groups and observe that the red rectangle is
bound to either the yellow group or the blue group.
Use the buttons on the left to move the box from one group into another.
