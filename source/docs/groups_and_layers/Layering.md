title: HTML5 Canvas Shape Layering
---

To layer shapes with Konva, we can use one of the following layering methods:
`moveToTop()`, `moveToBottom()`, `moveUp()`, `moveDown()`, or `zIndex()`.
You can also layer groups and layers.

Instructions: Drag and drop the boxes to move them around, and then use the
buttons on the left to reorder the yellow box.
