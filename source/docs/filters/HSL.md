title: HTML5 Canvas Hue, Saturation and Luminance filter Image Tutorial
---

To apply filter to an `Konva.Node`, we have to cache it first with `cache()` function. Then apply filter with `filter()` function.

To change hue, saturation and luminance components of an image with Konva, we can use the `Konva.Filters.HSL.

Instructions: Slide the controls to change hsl values.

For all available filters go to [Filters Documentation](/api/Konva.Filters.html).
