title: HTML5 Canvas Pixelate filter Image Tutorial
---

To apply filter to an `Konva.Node`, we have to cache it first with `cache()`
function. Then apply filter with `filter()` function.

To change pixelate effect of an image with Konva, we can use the `Konva.Filters.Pixelate`.

Instructions: Slide the control to change pixel size value.

For all available filters go to [Filters Documentation](/api/Konva.Filters.html).
