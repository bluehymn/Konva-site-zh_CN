`Konva.Transformer` automatically track properties of attached nodes.
So it will adopt its own properties automatically.

But is some cases `Konva.Transformer` can't do this. Currently `Konva.Transformer` can not track deep changes inside `Konva.Group` node. In this case you will need to use `forceUpdate` method to reset transforming tools
