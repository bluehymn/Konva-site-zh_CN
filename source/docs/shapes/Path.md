title: HTML5 canvas SVG Path Tutorial
---

To create an SVG path with Konva, we can instantiate a `Konva.Path()` object.

Paths are most commonly used when we want to export an SVG Path into an HTML5 Canvas path, or if we want to manifest complex drawings as a data string rather than creating a custom shape.

For a full list of attributes and methods, check out the [Konva.Path documentation](/cn.konvajs/api/Konva.Path.html).

If you want to draw full SVG image into the canvas take a look into [How to draw SVG image](/docs/sandbox/Animals_on_the_Beach_Game.html) post.
