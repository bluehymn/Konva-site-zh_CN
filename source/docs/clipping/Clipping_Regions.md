title: HTML5 Canvas Simple Clipping tutorial
---

To draw things inside of clipping regions with Konva, we can set the `clip`
property of a group or a layer.
Clipping regions are defined by an `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`.  In this tutorial,
we'll draw blobs inside of a rectangular clipping region applied to a group.

For more complex cases take a look into clipping function. [Clipping Function](/docs/clipping/Clipping_Function.html)
