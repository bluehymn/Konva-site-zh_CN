title: HTML5 Canvas Animate Position Tutorial
---

To animate a shape's position with Konva, we can create a new animation with `Konva.Animation`
which modifies the shape's position with each animation frame.

For a full list of attributes and methods, check out the [Konva.Animation documentation](/api/Konva.Animation.html).
