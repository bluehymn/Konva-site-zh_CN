title: HTML5 Canvas Listen or Donâ€™t Listen to Events with Konva
---

To listen or don't listen to events with Konva, we can set the listening
property of the config object to true or false when a shape is instantiated,
or we can set the listening property with the `setListening()` method.
Once we've set the listening property for one or more nodes, we'll also need
to redraw the hit graph for each affected layer with the `drawHit()` method.

Instructions: Mouseover the oval to observe that the event handler is not executed.
Click on "Listen" to start listening for events and observe that the event handler is now executed.
