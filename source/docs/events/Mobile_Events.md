title: HTML5 Canvas Mobile Touch Events Tutorial
---

To bind event handlers to shapes on a mobile device with Konva, we can use the `on()` method.
The `on()` method requires an event type and a function to be executed when the event occurs.
Konva supports `touchstart`, `touchmove`, `touchend`, `tap`, `dbltap`, `dragstart`, `dragmove`, and `dragend` mobile events.

For more complex gestures like `rotate` take a look into [Gestures Demo](/cn.konvajs/docs/sandbox/Gestures.html).

*Note: This example only works on iOS and Android mobile devices because it makes use of touch events rather than mouse events.*

Instructions: move your finger across the triangle to see touch coordinates and touch start and touch end the circle.
