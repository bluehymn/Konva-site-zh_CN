title: HTML5 Canvas Drag and Drop an Image
---

To drag and drop an image with Konva, we can set the `draggable` property
to true when we instantiate a shape, or we can use the `draggable()` method.
The `draggable()` method enables drag and drop for both desktop and mobile
applications automatically.
