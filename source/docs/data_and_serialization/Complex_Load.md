title: Load HTML5 Canvas Stage from JSON Tutorial
---

## How to import canvas from JSON?

To load a complex stage that originally contained images and event bindings using Konva,
we need to create a stage node using `Konva.Node.create()`, and then set the
images and event handlers with the help of selectors using the `find()` method.
Images and event handlers must be manually set because they aren't serializable.

**That methods works for small apps. For more complex cases take a look into [Best Practices](/docs/data_and_serialization/Best_Practices.html)**
