## Do you want to show a context menu for a canvas shape?

To show a context menu we have to:

1. Listen to `contextmenu` event on canvas container (stage)
2. Prevent default browser behavior, so we don't see native context menu
3. Create our own context menu with `Konva` tools or regular html

**Instructions: double click on the stage to create a circle. Try right click (context menu) on shapes for a menu.**
